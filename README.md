## Matlab ginput function with added on-demand zoom and pan capability

Same as ginput, but you can now zoom in and pan to different part of the data, while ginput is running. To zoom in, press "z" button on keyboard and then use left mouse or mouse wheel to zoom in and also zoom out, and to reset zoom use double left click. To pan, while ginputzp is running, press x on the keyboard and use left click and drag to pan and do the selection with middle or right mouse button.
